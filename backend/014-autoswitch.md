# AutoSwitch

## Context

We want to dynamically switch vendors whenever there are issue.

For example, we may have two different vendors serving the same products. However, one of them may be more prone to downtime, but has higher margin. On the other hand, the more reliable one is more expensive.

We want to optimise the profit, so instead of opting for one, we always go for the cheaper one. If the cheaper one is unreliable, then we can switch to the more expensive one.

This combines certain logic like load balancing, circuit breaker etc.
