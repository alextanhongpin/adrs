# User Preferences 
Usually one will come across scenarios such as `if the user already close the popup, don't show it again`.

There are also scenarios where there is a need to store user settings, e.g. turn on/off pin settings. We can store thoee settings as json column in `users` table.

So all settings can be retrieved when getting the user details
