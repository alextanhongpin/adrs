# Career path simulation

## Status

`draft`


## Context

Most developers have a fixed responsibility. They stay in the comfort zone for years.

This is bad since it doesn't encourage growth.

However, just throwing them out of the comfort zone is bad too, since there will be lack of confidence as well as knowledge. 

## Decisions

Simulation of growth career.

Instead of throwing them unprepared into the real world project, do a simulation.

```
You are a backend lead in an AI company
You are expected to lead a new project
```

From the simulation prompt, the engineer should then start outlining their approach as well as execute a small project.
