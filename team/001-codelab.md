# Codelab

## Status

`draft`


## Context

Onboarding engineers to a new project is not easy, especially when there is already a structure in place. To get engineers to be productive ASAP and start adding value, we need a way to onboard them on the technical aspect.


## Decision

We will create tutorials and workshops on core concepts for a project. The advantage is, the codelab can be shared and extended to different teams using the same technology.


## Consequences

_TBD_.
