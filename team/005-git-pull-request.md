# Git Pull Request


## Status

`draft`

## Context

A PR is not about just adding or removing new lines of codes.


A good PR allows someone without context of the PR to be able to understand and implement the functionality in that PR.


## Decision


Keep the PR small so that the changes are easy to understand.
