# Documentation


## Status

`draft`

## Context

Documenting your work helps others to understand the decisions made during the design of a project.

However, there are no clear guidelines on how to create good documentation.

Also, there is no one fixed template for documenting tech decisions.

There are however many templates for documenting different tech decisions/processes:

- changelog
- deployment changelog
- changedocs
- runbook for on-call
- service architecture diagram
- architecture decision record
- user story
- use case
- C4
- UML (sequence diagram, flow diagram)
- ERD for database schema

and many more. A good documentation starts from the repository Readme.

## Decisions

This ADR should address the common documentation required and also how to structure them.

We first need to categorize and classify the common documentation.
