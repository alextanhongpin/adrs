# Self-Onboarding

## Status

`draft`

## Context

A new engineer should be able to be productive immediately in a new team. However, not all teams have proper onboarding processes.

This can lead to inefficiency, especially when the new engineer will not know what to look for or is afraid to ask questions. Also, there will be a lot of context switching when starting with a task, due to the lack of access/knowledge etc.


## Decisions

The new engineer should not join a new team with the assumption that everything will be provided.

There are always a few starting point to get to know the processes/team structure/code.

The obvious one is to just ask questions. 


The other option is to explore:
1. documentations in knowledge base, such as Confluence/Notion
2. search code and merge requests in Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket
3. past conversations in Slack

Especially in large organizations, it is very easy to ask questions that has already been asked before. This itself could be a red flag.
