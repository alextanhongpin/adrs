# RFC: Implementing Repository Pattern in Python

## Abstract

This RFC proposes the implementation of the Repository Pattern in Python. The Repository Pattern is a way to abstract data access, making it possible to change the data source without altering the business code that uses it.

## Specification

### Step 1: Define the Repository Interface

We will define an abstract base class `IRepository` that will serve as the interface for our repositories. This class will define the following methods:

- `get_all`: Returns all entities.
- `get`: Returns a single entity by its ID.
- `add`: Adds a new entity.
- `remove`: Removes an entity by its ID.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List

class IRepository(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_all(self) -> List:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get(self, id: int):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def add(self, entity):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def remove(self, id: int):
        pass
```

### Step 2: Implement the Repository Interface

We will create a concrete implementation of `IRepository` called `MyRepository`. This class will use a simple list as the data source.

```python
class MyRepository(IRepository):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = []

    def get_all(self) -> List:
        return self.data

    def get(self, id: int):
        for entity in self.data:
            if entity.id == id:
                return entity
        return None

    def add(self, entity):
        self.data.append(entity)

    def remove(self, id: int):
        entity = self.get(id)
        if entity:
            self.data.remove(entity)
```

### Step 3: Use the Repository in Business Code

Our business code will use a repository to get data. It will not care how the data is stored or retrieved. The specific data source is abstracted away by the repository.

```python
def business_function(repo: IRepository):
    entities = repo.get_all()
    # Do something with entities
```

## Rationale

The Repository Pattern provides a clean separation of concerns and a more testable, maintainable architecture. It allows the data access logic to be isolated from the business logic, making it easier to change the data source or implement different strategies for caching, lazy loading, and testing.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal does not affect any existing code and is fully backwards compatible.

## Security Considerations

There are no known security implications associated with this proposal.

## How to Teach This

The Repository Pattern is a well-known design pattern in object-oriented programming. It can be taught as part of a course or tutorial on software architecture or design patterns.
