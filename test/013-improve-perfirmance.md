# Improve performance 

This is not just for test, but generally for everything (metrics, KPI).

- for the same amount of time, more cycles
- use less cpu/memory for the same application
- increase in number of requests with same latency

Is A better than B?
- lower value of mem/cpu/request
- higher value of requests
- fixed for a set of variables
