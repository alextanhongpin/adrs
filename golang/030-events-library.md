# Events Library

## Status

`draft`

## Context

This ADR addresses the collection of metrics for libraries as well as logging etc 

Slog has been released, and there is also the experimental events libraries 

Collecting metrics is important, but it is hard to tap into all the critical sections of the library.

Library author need to provide hooks to those metrics endpoints
