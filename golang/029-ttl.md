# TTL

## Context

How to build a more performant TTL mechanism for local cache?

Maintaining a set of keys that could expire is challenging, because we need to keep pooling periodically to check if there are keys that expired.


## Decision

Break the operation into time window.

### Array of expiry duration

When adding a new key with ttl, add the ttl to array of expiry duration. Since this array will only contain increasing time (assuming the TTL is constant too), we can also check the last item to see if the same expiry duration already exists.

If the time is less than the last time, dont need to append.

### Batch expiry

Before appending the deadline, round it up to the nearest nth, where nth can be 5s or 10s.

This will group the keys according to time window, and expire them at the same time 


### Lazy vacuum

Instead of running a background job that will execute in the background, we can trigger it lazily when setting the TTL key instead.

This reduces the need to coordinate cleanup.

Check if the first time is before now, if yes, perform a cleanup.

If we are running it as a background job, we can shift the first item in the slice, then sleep until the next deadline to execute.
