### Guidelines for Integrating Third-Party APIs

When integrating third-party APIs into your application, it is crucial to follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth and successful process:

1. **Abstract the API Layer**: The focus of your development should be on creating an abstract layer for the third-party API. This involves hiding the complexities of making HTTP requests and instead providing a clean and consistent API interface that your application can use.

2. **Data Handling**: You will need to handle the conversion of JSON to a format that your application can use. This usually involves converting JSON to a Go struct or another data structure suitable for your domain. Ensure that this is done in a reliable and efficient manner.

3. **Testing**: It is essential to test the API client comprehensively. Using a test server allows you to verify the correctness of the data being sent and received. You should focus on testing the serialization and deserialization processes to ensure that data is converted correctly between the test server and the API client.

4. **Domain Model**: Create a domain model that represents the data in a format most suitable for your application. This model should be independent of the API and any other external dependencies.

5.  **Avoid Business Logic**: It is recommended to keep business logic out of the API integration layer. The integration layer's role is to handle the interaction with the third-party API
