# Use domain


## Status

`draft`

## Context

The domain layer encapsulates the business logic and does not have any external dependencies. 

Business logic should belong to the domain layer. The behaviour is normally encapsulated in a class. Thr combination of data plus behaviour gives us object oriented programming, which is the heart of domain layer.

Not all logic needed to be encapsulated in a class. Prefer pure functions over class. 

## Decisions

Create domain layer.
