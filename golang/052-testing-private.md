## Status

`draft`


## Context

There are two kind of testing, whitebox testig and blackbox testing.

At certain layers, it is more useful to perform blackbox testing (presentation layer) versus whitebox testing (usecase layer).

We may also want to test the internal of certain implementation such as the repository layer.
