# Use Timeout


## What

The default server does not come preconfigured with timeouts - which means the server waits indefinitely. This posts [^1] explores more about HTTP timeouts in golang for both client and server implementation.

## How

See [use-graceful-shutdown](https://github.com/alextanhongpin/architecture-decision-records/blob/master/golang/use-graceful-shutdown.md).
