# Golang ADR

This is a list of ADRs specifically for development using golang programming language.

They may focus on specific language features or libraries which may not be applicable to other languages.

Language is just a tool, so prefer to work on general practices rather than specific ones (breadth over depth).

However, if you are looking for depth, then this might be right for you.

Most of the ADRs here might be incomplete or require adjustment, so fork it and modify it accordingly.

```ts
class GolangADR extends BaseADR {}
```
