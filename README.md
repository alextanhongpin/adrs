# Architecture Decision Records

My own personal ADR.


## Why

- to record the why
- narrow down hard choices (most comparisons are apple vs oranges)
- what is obvious to you may not be obvious to others
- a decision tree for architecture


## Template

```markdown
# Title

## Status

<!--What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.? -->
`proposed`


## Context

<!--What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?-->


## Decision

<!--What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?-->


## Consequences

<!--What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?-->
```
