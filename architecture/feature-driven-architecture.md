# Feature Driven Architecture


What is one of the main issue when working on large legacy projects?

- there's too many layer
- logic are distributed across different layer
- too many jumps just to understand how the whole piece works


FDD tries to solve this by placing all the logic into a single file.

If there are issues with the feature, then jusy need to look at one file.
