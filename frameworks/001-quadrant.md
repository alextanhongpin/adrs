# Quadrant Technique

## Context


Not all decision can be measured quantitatively. However, we can still measure them relative to one another.


For example, when it comes to feature to prioritize, we can place them in a quadrant where the x-axis could be difficulty, while the y-value could be value.

With this, we will have four quadrants, from top, left to right and bottom, left to right.

- easy, high value
- difficult, high value
- easy low value
- difficult, low value

We can then decide on what feature to build and the value it brings.

Another example is during interview process. We can have one axis representing yes/no, while the other axis representing soft/strong:

- soft yes
- soft no
- strong yes
- strong no

Which would probably add more range to decision making compared to just yes or no.

## Decision

Plot your decisions in a two-dimensional plot and find out where your options lies in the quadrant.
