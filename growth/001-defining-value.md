# Defining Value

## Status

`draft`

## Context

Not all work produce the same value. Doing more work does not equal more value, especially when the overall impact is low. 

It is hard to measure the relative value of an impact, but we can measure it relative to other impact.

We do so by defining a quadrant. The y-axis will be a measure of impact, while the x-axis is the measure of effort.

We can plot the activities on this quadrants and decide on what is the best course of action.

Most organisations avoid high effort and possibly high impact activity, mainly because they are tempted by the low effort high impact task.

In reality, the high effort task can be further broken into smaller tasks but with accumulating impact. 

For low effort low impact, this can be delegated to more junior roles as an aspirational task. The small things eventually adds up.

## Decisions

Place tasks on the impact-effort quadrant to get a bird-eye's view of the value each task brings.

Break high effort tasks to smaller tasks with accumulating impact.
