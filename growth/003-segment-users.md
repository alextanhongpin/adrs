## Actions
Segmenting users is the first step. After segmenting the users, we can now take better actions.


Most team delivers features for all users. However, it is important to understand that 80% of revenues comes from 20% of the users (pareto principle). So sometimes it is better to focus on the top 20% of the users only.

They can be the main users for feature rollouts/testing etc, so you can test them out first.


We can use bloom filter to maintain the users segmentation.
