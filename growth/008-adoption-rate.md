# Adoption Rate

Even for free features, we should measure the performance of the feature.

In this case, it is the adoption rate. We can meausre adoption rate month over month by just measuring the number of unique users that calls the feature divided by the current number of users.

We can rank them and see which features are used more frequently.

Wr can also measure the month over monyh increase
