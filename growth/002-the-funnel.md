# The Funnel


Effective user funnel and segmentation is necessary to strategize for app growth.

Everything after user registration is a funnel.

For example, feature adoption is basically the number of users that adopt (your own definition, e.g clicked a link or paid for subscription) a feature divided by the total number of active users. 

You can do this for every feature you have. Created a new endpoint? count the number of unique logged in users hitting it.

For anonymous users, treat them as opportunities, and find reasons for conversion.


## Active Users

Once you have the users table, you can further segment them. 

For example, everytime they logged in, store the last logged in timestamp
 The user is inactive if the last logged in is more than 90 days. If it is more than a year, the user is deactivated. The rest are active users.

 Based on this segmentation, you can then focus on reactivation for inactive users, or reengagement for active users plus opportunities.
