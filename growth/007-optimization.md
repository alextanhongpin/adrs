# Optimization

What can you optimise?

- minimize cost
- minimize time
- maximize revenue

We can minimize cost by going lean.

We can minimize time by having better processes or handbook or decision making tools.

Forecast capabilities is essential. But since that is not possible, we want to know what decision to take based on past data.
