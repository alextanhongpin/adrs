# Growth Metrics

Separate into two
- the dollar (unit) formula
- the percentage formula

Allows us to see the relative and absolute value.

Use relative value for bird's eye view, e.g. we grow 20% YoY.


We need the ability to `diff` snapshots of metrics.

The snapshots should be taken periodically, e.g  monthly.

The `diff` between the two snapshots should provide overview of the system's health.

Similar to financing, we treat the metrics like cash flow.

Using both dollar formula and percentage formula

- the growth rate (increase or decrease)
