# Cheap Hosting

As a dev, I want the cheapest possible hosting to run my beta apps.

## Object Storage
- AWS S3
- Cloudflare R2 (probably the best)
- Digital Ocean Spaces

## Database
- Supabase? The free tier allows up to 500mb. We can also create separate schemas to host other app.
- When it gets large, just dump the data into another db

## Backend
- Google cloud AppEngine
- AWS Lightsail (close to Linode)
