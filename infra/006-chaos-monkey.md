# Chaks Monkey


How do we simulate load testing and auto scaling? We can do that in kubernetes with horizontal pod autoscaler and setting hard limit on cpu and memory.

We can measure the number of requests as well as the respinse time.

we set SLI/SLO/SLA and measure them.

we also bring down other infrastructure and see how it impacts the application. is there a way to know what usecase uses what dependencies?
